to call a custom log in odoo

import 2 lines

from odoo.tools.misc import get_lang
import logging 

now set a value ( call it logger ) 


logger = logging.getlogger()

it has many parameters 

__name__ get the name of the module 

 and now after that target where you want to call the log after
 
 so for example if the email is set or when the state changes from draft to in progress is done :) 

this logger has many attributes

logger.info()
logger.error()
 
the best way to apply what's inside of them is thru the format way

    def action_validate(self):
        for record in self:
            logger.info(f"Course{record.name} is in progress now by {self.env.user.name} ")
            record.write({'state': 'in_progress'})

add info error in anywhere
