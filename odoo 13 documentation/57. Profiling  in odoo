profiling is just showing how long does it take for a method to load or to execute (Shows the statistics of a certain method) 

there are 2 ways to show the profiling 
1.Graph method
2.Log method

the difference in the implementation doesn't vary a lot


1. Graph method

from odoo.tools.misc import profile # this is common for both 

@profile('/temp/prof.profile')
def the_func('here you pass the ')

then you can show the graph thru 2 codes 'they are found in the odoo official website :) '

2. Log method
it'll show the stats of the method in a log form 

from odoo.tools.profiler import profile

and then then target the function in which you want to check its optimity

@profile
@api.model
def the_func()
