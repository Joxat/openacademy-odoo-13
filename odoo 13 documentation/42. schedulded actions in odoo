to set a scheduled action in odoo

you can create it thru GUI 
go to settings > technical > scheduled actions
press create and start making !!!


to add scheduled actions through coding then simply do :  
find a field that's active then copy the external id of it 

now in the xml you'll find the file that has the simmilar syntax

<record id="ir_cron_openacademy" model="ir.cron">
            <field name="name">Session Notifier</field>
            <field name="model_id" ref="model_openacademy_session"/>
            <field name="state">code</field>
            <field name="code">model.openacademy_session_ir_cron()</field>
            <field name="user_id" ref="base.user_root"/>
            <field name="interval_number">1</field>
            <field name="interval_type">days</field>
            <field name="numbercall">-1</field>
</record>

so each field refers to what's written inside of it (lol)
but in the code

scheduled actions are used with emails i believe ???? 

e.g it is used to send emails to those who haven't received any sort of emails 
to get that working first create a Boolean field named email_list(or whatever ) 
in your targetted model : mine is openacademy.session
email_list = fields.Boolean(default=False, string="Email")  
so now this assumes every student hasn't received any email ( in this model only ) 


now let's create the function in which it indicates for the field name=code "openacademy_session_ir_cron()"

def openacademy_session_ir_cron(self):
    sessions_emails = self.env(['openacademy.session']).search('email_list','=',False)
    for session in sessions_emails:
      if session is False:
        session.call_the_email_function()
        session.email = True
        
        
so this only sends emails of sessions to students who has email_list = false
