to add another item to the menu for example in the sales/products/products 
the second product( child )  is an item in the products menu ( parent) 
let's add another product service item in the products menu do the following :
go to settings
then technial menu 
then menu items 
then search for the menu where you want to add an item in it 
as mentioned i want to add it in the products menu
so search for products 
you'll get to see the following route
sales/products/products
so in order to add another item in the products menu , you just need to copy the data of the second prouduct item and change it according to your needs so it'll appear in the menu of products (the parent)
let's add service item now 
after you've navigated in the sales/products/products
and then click on the bugs icon and then navigate view matadata
then lookup for the XML file for example here it includes : sale.menu_product_template_action
the sale indicates for the module/app so it belongs in the sales app
and the .menu_product_template_action is the id of the menudata 
so in your framework ( vscode - pycharm - eclipse ..... etc )
navigate for odoo/addons/sale and then search for the action that has product_template_action
so it'll take you straighforward to a menudata tag with the same id 
copy it to your custom addon file 

<menu id ="menu_product_template_action" action = " product_template_action" parent="sale.product_menu_catalog" sequence="3" active="False" > 

this is how it looks and now let's adjust it to the needs 
so add the id to the custom addon e.g  menu_product_template_action_od_sales
and for the action the name of your attribute e.g service product_template_action_Product_service
and the sequence put in which order you'd like to see the product on the menu , 3rd, 4th, 5th ... etc and set active to True to be shown on the list
and then lookup for the action's id and navigate for the record tag and copy it to the custom addons xml file which locates in the views lol ikr 
then customize it as the following 
the action of the item action to the id of the record
CUSTOMIZE IT ON YOUR OWN !!!
