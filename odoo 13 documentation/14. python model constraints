to add a constraint in python simply there are a few things need to be taken into consideration

from odoo.exceptions import ValidationError #first import this !!!
#then the constraint
@api.constrains('age')
def _check_something(self):
  if self.age > 20 :
  	raise ValidationError("Your record is too old: %s" self.age)
 

 @api.constrains('user', 'attendees')
    def _check_ct(self):
        if self.user in self.attendees:
            raise exceptions.ValidationError('you cannot have an instructor as an attendee! ')


in api.constraint and api.onchange you don't need to add the function's name as in the computed fields
