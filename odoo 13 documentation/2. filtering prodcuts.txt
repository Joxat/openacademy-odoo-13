( list_price )
now back to the products lists and click on the EditControlPanel View and now see the following
<filter string = 'name of the filter option ' name = 'any category ' domain = "[('name of the field that filtering should fall into or wants to affect ', logic , value)]"
for the logic there arthimetic operations : >= , <= , = , but they not written in that way 
&lt;= less than or equal 

<filter string="Standard Low Price" name="filter_to_Low_Price" domain="[('standard_price','&lt;=',1000)]"/>
