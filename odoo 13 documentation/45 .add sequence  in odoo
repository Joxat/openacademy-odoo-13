sequence as the name tells is sequence of names 

LOL/2010/0001
Freefire/2022/0001

they are showen below the header always 


to see how add a sequence first navigate the sequence model 

settings > technical > sequence

so the sequence model is ir.sequence 
click on any sequencec and then find the external id of it

e.g this ready-made xml code 

  <record id="openacademy_course" model="ir.sequence">
            <field name="name">openacademy course</field>
            <field name="code">openacademy.course.sequence</field>
            <field name="prefix">Course/%(year)s/</field>
            <field eval="1" name="number_next"/>
            <field eval="1" name="number_increment"/>
            <field eval="False" name="company_id"/>
            <field name="padding">4</field>
  </record>
  
  
  now create a sequence xml file in the data file
  add it to the manifest file
  
  before applying sequenece make sure that you have a field name with a default value of something so the sequecnce affect 
  has to appear in the Form view cool then, 
  
  so 
  
  name = fields.Char(string="Name", readonly=True, required=True, default="new", index=True)
  new is the conventional naming for the sequence function , on regular basis you can call it 
  whatever you want
  
  now let's create a function that represents the sequence 
  
  @api.model
  def create(self,vals):
   if vals.get(name,'new') == 'new':
            vals['name'] = self.env['ir.sequence'].next_by_code('openacademy.course.sequence')
  return super(course,self).create(vals)
