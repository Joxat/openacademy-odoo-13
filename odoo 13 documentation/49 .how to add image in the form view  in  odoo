to add an image in the form view in odoo : 

define an image as a field
notice that images are conventionally named in numbers

image_100 = fields.Image(String='Image')

<field name='image_100' widget='image' class='oe_avatar' options={'preview_image':'image_128', 'zoom_delay':500}/>

image_128 is the one of the images type 


options has different parameters as well 

preview_image : contains many types one of them is 'image_128'
zoodelay : number in ms


and hop in the form view and then edit or 



be sorely disappointed
