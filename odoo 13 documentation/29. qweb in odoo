the report engine is based on QWeb, Twitter Bootstrap and Wkhtmltopdf

the report consists of 2 elements

it.actions.report for which a <report> shortcut element is provided 

<report
id="openacademy_session" #any id , it has to be unique 
model="openacademy.session"
string="Session Report"
report_type="qweb-pdf" # or report_type="qweb-html"
name="openacademy.report_session_view" name of the customaddon for example mine is openacademy.name_in_which_you're_gonna_put_in_the_id_of_template    
file="openacademy.report_session"
attachment_use="True"
attachment="here you set the logic ??? and you can leave it empty"
/>

THIS IS THE STANDARD QWEB view for the report !!!!!!! excited!!!!!!


<template id="report_session_view"> #here in the id you pass in the name of the report without the name of the addon
 <t t-call="web.html_container"> #contains the report 
   <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="doc"> #foreach to loop through each record "doc" that's contained in the "docs" and print each record in a spereate page
    <t t-call="web.external_layout">#this adds header and footer for each report
