so in the sql method affects model's fields
it depends on a certain reserved fields on the postgresql

_sql_constraints = [

('string','the reserved constraint','message to be shown')
]

_sql_constraints = [

('whatever',
'check(field1=!field2)',
'message to be shown')

_sql_constraints = [

('name and description check',
'check(name=!description)',
'name and description should ont be the same')

('name and description check',
'unique(name)',
'name field should be unique')

]


-- notes: 
this method only works for the fields in the same group only 

like in the form view for example
<form>
<group>
<field name = 'something1'/>
<field name = 'something2'/>
</group>
<group>
<notebook>
<field name = 'something3'>
</notebook>
</gruoup>
</form>

so here you cannot link something1 or something2 to something3 field since they don't belong to the same group , yeaaaaaaaaaaaah
