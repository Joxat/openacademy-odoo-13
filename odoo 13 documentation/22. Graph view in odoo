Graph view in odoo allows aggregated views of the model 

it looks as any other view in odoo

<graph>


</graph>

it has parameters such as "type" and this "type" holds many attributes

<graph type="">

</graph>

types of "type" : 
1. bar : first dimension represents the horizontal axis , the other dimensions represents the aggregated bars within each group lol
2. pie : dimensional pie
3. line: diemnsional line 


and the field inside of it has 2 values
1. row
2. measure

the field has to somewhat relate to some a computed filed 
so let's create a graph field 

in the .py file add the following 

attendees_no = fields.Integer(string="Attendees Number",compute="_get_attendee_no")

@api.depends('attendees')
def _get_attendee_no(self):
 self.attendees_no = len(self.attendees)
 
 now
