this method is just to move a model from a view to another view thru a button

to create an action for an exissting module do the following 

find the module that has the feature then navigate it's model 
it is found in the many2many fields that are connected to a certain form view 
for example in the sale module in the form view of the products then the many2many page click on a product 

e.g in the sale module > order > quatation and then pick one of the qoutations 
you'll see the form view of one of the quotations poping up, in its many2many field just click on it and an action will pop up
this is the action i mean lol 


you just inherit a model that has the same feature 

and then create a button that moves you from view to another "object type"

and in the custom module you created to inherit the specific id

e.g 

_inherit =  sale.order.line

here you want to insert a button that moves you from the form view you are in to another view 

you can do this anywhere thru python method ( which done normally thru actions ) 

so call the method create a button , insert it literally wherever you want !!! 

<button name='move_to_tree' type='' string='' >

</button> 


def move_to_tree(self):
  return{
  'name':,
  'res_model':'sale.order.line',
  'view_model':'tree,form',
  'domain':'',
  'context':{},
  'type':'ir.actions.act_windows',
  'view':[(self.env.ref(od_sales.view.sdwaasd).id, 'tree')]
  }
