YOU ADD DOMAIN IN customaddon


to add a domain to your custom addon file 
add a field that should look like in the record tag of actions and above the <record type = 'arch'...> tag 
<field name ="domain"> [('' , '' , '')] </field>

so the first void takes the field's type , could be type , categ_id
the second void should take , = , >= , <= , &lt;= ,
the third void should take the selection of the field's type 

so it should look more like for example
<field name ="domain"> [('type' , '='  , 'service')] </field>
