to call a python method in qweb report simply do the following : 



1. in the located .py file that has the model's details just add a plain python function
e.g 
def get_attendees_no(self): 
   return (self.field) #This field should return the number of attendees 
   ( this is just an example) 
   

2. now in the meant qweb xml file just add a <t/> tag with t-esc included 
e.g <h3> <t t-esc=""/> now in the blank add the doc or the set value that's been set when 
you decided to loop through it 
this is a bit weird but lemme explain 

<t t-foreach="docs" t-set="doc">
this "doc" of "t-set" is what's used to call the python's method
now let's call it again 

<h3> <t t-esc="doc.get_attendees_no()"/></h3>

 now in the report this method should call the number of attendees
