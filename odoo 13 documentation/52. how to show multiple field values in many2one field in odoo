it is so simple

in your .py file in any model without actually targetting any field  
it is a somewhat ready-made function/method called name_get 


def name_get(self): 
   result = []
   for record in self:
     name = f"{record.name} {record.course_id}"     #record.field that you have defined in your model :*(
     result.append((record.id, name))
   return result
