create a static file " this is by convention " and create the following directory : static/src/style/style.css
to add a custom css in odoo all that you need to do is to add the style tag   

<link rel="stylesheet" href="static/src/style/style.css"/>
and then start adding classes and ids " classes prefered " 

then customize as much as you want :))) 

small progress is good but it kills 




TRUST LONG PROCESS
