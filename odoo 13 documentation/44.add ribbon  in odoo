ribbon are the tape that's located on the top right corner whenever you affect e.g the state of the model
e.g again when you move a state from draft to cancel or complete the ribbon shows at which state you're at or when it is set to a certain state


so the syntax of ribbon is simple


<widget name='web_ribbon' title='the_title' bg_color="bootstrap selection of colors" attrs="{'invisible':[('state','!=','Cancel')]}"    />
