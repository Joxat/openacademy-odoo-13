here you're gonna learn 3 things

1. how to use xpath
2. how to inherit from a certain module 
3. how to apply some changes on the inherited module 

let's start

add an xml file in the reports file and name it accordingly to the module 
sale_qweb_inherit.xml

now in the odoo find the external id of the module , for example i'm in the sale and i want to print the quotation
first navigate the name written on the print e.g it is Quatation/order
go to setting --> technical --> reports 
type the name of the report in the search bar "Quatation/order"
then navigate inside 
then look up for the Template Name : e.g "report_saleorder"
look up for that name in the addons file
now after that 
find the template that has the same name as the template's name "report_saleorder"

<template id="report_saleorder">
    <t t-call="web.html_container">
        <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="doc">
            <t t-call="sale.report_saleorder_document" t-lang="doc.partner_id.lang"/>
        </t>
    </t>
</template>

now see the class that has the t-call and use it for inhertation

<template id="report_saleorder_document_inherited" inherit_id="sale.report_saleorder_document">
  
</template>

now navigate the report_saleorder_document in the addon files
see which changes you wanna make

and use the xpath way to target a certain tag 
and simply it'll look more like 

xpath expr="//" it starts with double slashes"//"
then you start targetting divs and if happen and there are multiple divs that are on the same flow then you'll use an attribute called [hasclass] e.g div[hasclass('class_name')]
