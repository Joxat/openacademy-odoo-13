to add a custom css in odoo then do the following 

create a .xml file name it whatever 
create a css file in the static file 
add the xml file to the manifest file

in the xml file inherit from web.assets_backend 

<odoo>
<template inherit_id="web.assets_backend" id="assets_backend_whatever" name="OA_assets_backend">
<xpath expr="." position="inside">
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/openacademy/static/css/style.css"/>
</xpath>
</template>
</odoo>

and now in the css file you can customize it according to the class you define in the xml file
 
now customize it according to your CSS knowledge :)
