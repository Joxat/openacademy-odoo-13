just create a wizard.xml and a wizard.py files 
add the transient model and all that stuff
then in the xml add the menus and actions ( you know how ) 



all that matters is the button in the form view 
adjust it to be from create/cancel to Print/cancel 

so in the footer just code 

<footer>
<button name='print_pdf_report' string='Print' class='btn-primary' type='object'/> 
<button special ='cancel' string='Cancel' class='btn-secondary'/>

</footer>

now let's define the function of the name 'print_pdf_report'

in the wizard.py file


def print_pdf_report(self): ---> this is the function, now follow the next steps carefully
  self.env.ref() ----> first step is to define the xml file in which you want to move the data to 
  let's say we have an xml file with the name openacademy_report_pdf.xml
  so if we have a report that has the following parameters 
  self.env.ref(model.name_of_xml_file).report_action(self, data=data)
  
  <report id='openacademy_print_pdf'
  	  model ='openacadmy.wizard.pdf'
  	  name='openacademy.pdf_template'
  
  
   />
 


in order to report and get the data from different models use models.Abstract
before you type it make sure that you are aware of the main syntax

class PDF_report(models.AbstractModel): 
   _name = report.model.the_name_of_the_template_of_the_wizard
   _name = report.the value of the name in the report e.g  name='openacademy.pdf_template'this is what's gonna be passed in  
   _name = report.openacademy.openacademy.pdf_template
