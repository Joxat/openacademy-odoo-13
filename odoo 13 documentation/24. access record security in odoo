in odoo there are many types of security that you have to include one by one, one of them is Access record 

before i get started with it 

it is  defined as records of the model "ir.model.access" 
in the csv file it has set of permissions

read,write,create,unlink
in the csv file which is named after model ir.model.access.csv

id,name,model_id/id,prem_read,prem_write,prem_create,prem_unlink
access_idea,idea,idea.idea,base.group_user,1,1,1,0 

so generally to create an access record security 
create a user through settings -> users -> create
and then create group Settings -> User and Companies -> Groups
and then create/or select a group but here we're gonna create
so create and you'll proceed to a form view with some fields

Application : this is the category set in the __manifest__.py file
category : 'Test'
and navigate the access records in the notebook of the view
you'll see Name,object(model),read,write,create,delete
this is how to add from the GUI 

but through the back-end
security

in the security file you add
security.xml
and the ir.model.access.csv file

in the security.xml file you create the record in which represents the group the user will belong to? 

<odoo>
<data noupdate=1>
<record model='res.group' id="this is the id in which you should insert to gain access record for this group" />
</data>
</odoo>


<odoo>
<data noupdate=1>
<record model='res.group' id="res_group_read_access" />
<field name="name">Read Sessions</field>
</record>
</data>
</odoo>



in the ir.model.access.csv file add adjust the model according to the following 


id,name,model_id/id,prem_read,prem_write,prem_create,prem_unlink
access_openacademy_session,openacademy.session,model_openacademy.session,read_access_group,1,1,1,0

id represents the name of the model which in this case is openacademy_session (* the access_ is done by convension or it is already reserved*)

name :name it to whichever you want to name

model_id : this says add model_ + id 
so it does look like model_openacademy_session(replace the dot(.) with underscore(_) so the model name is openacademy.session but when you want to insert in the model_id attribute you set to replace the . with _ 

group_id/id: this one is the id of the record that's been created in the securtiy.xml file and in this case i called it res_group_read_access

for the latter 4, just set it to whichever 1,0,0,0


something to note that the name you pass in the record of the security xml file will be shown in the access record on the framwork on the GUI side , in this case i've called my field name "Read Sessions", so it'll be shown like that :))))))) and this is it for the access record security in odoo FW


now after that you just set this group to the user and it'll show the model as what's been set in the .csv file

when you don't set the group_id to something like you leave the blank empty as it is it'll be general to every user set to that group
